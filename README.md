# Our-World-Connected-cisco-networking
Created as part of the Cisco Networking Academy project, combining:  data science  technology  global communication  psychological understanding of human connectivity
# 🌐 Global Internet Growth Analysis
Exploring How Close We Are to a Fully Connected World

Cisco technologies power the backbone of the Internet, enabling global communication and connection.
In this project, you analyze how the Internet grew from just 3 million users in 1990 to billions today—and what this means for our planet’s digital future.

#📌 Project Overview

Using Python, you investigate:

When did Internet users first exceed 100 million?

What percentage of the world was online each year?

When did we cross the milestone of half the world connected?

How does Internet growth correlate with global population growth?

You will explore two datasets:

world-internet-users.csv

historical-world-population.csv

This project blends data science, technology, and psychology, helping you understand how global connectivity shapes human behavior and communities.

#🧠 Why This Project Matters

From a psychological perspective, connectivity shapes:

how people learn

how cultures interact

how communities grow

how information influences beliefs

Tracking the rise of Internet usage helps us understand how humans adapt to technology and how technology transforms us.

#🧬 Features

✔ Load annual Internet-user and world-population data
✔ Merge datasets for correlated analysis
✔ Clean NaN values for accurate insights
✔ Calculate percent of global population online
✔ Visualize growth using Matplotlib
✔ Identify the year the world reached 50% connectivity

#📊 Technologies Used

-Python

-Pandas

-Matplotlib

-CSV datasets

-Colab Notebook
📈 Key Insights From the Analysis

In 1990, internet usage was only 0.06% of the world population.

The number of users exceeded 100 million in 1997.

By 2022, over 66% of humanity was online.

The world first crossed 50% connectivity in 2019.

This reveals the psychological shift toward digital reliance, communication, and global community building.
